# CS50p - Introduction to Programming with Python

This is a repository for Harvard's CS50p course projects.

These are my solutions to the problem sets and they can be run locally. Some may contain web applications and need more than the terminal input of `python app_name.py` to run.

In this case, to run a Python web application locally, navigate to your project directory in the terminal, then execute the command `python app.py` (where "app.py" is the name of your Python file containing the web application logic), which will start a local server. You can then access your application in a web browser by going to http://localhost:5000 (or the specified port number in your code).

# About The Course:

### What is CS50p?

CS50p is an online adaptation of Harvard University's well-known introductory programming course, CS50. Designed to cater to learners of all experience levels, CS50p focuses on the fundamental concepts of programming using Python. Participants explore programming concepts, data structures, web development, and more. The course emphasizes practical, hands-on learning through a variety of projects and problem sets. By completing CS50p, learners gain a solid foundation in Python programming and acquire the skills necessary to tackle real-world programming challenges.
