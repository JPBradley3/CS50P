## Starting code with known variables 'c' and 'm' and declaring them to be integers at the start to simplify.

c = int(300000000)
m = int(input("Please input m as a mass in Kilograms(Kg): "))

## Calculating for the "NEW VARIABLE" 'e' and then printing E=mc^2 as an integer result
e = m * c**2

print(e)
